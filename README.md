# Vertex

![Demonstration](Vertex_demonstration.gif)

A minimalistic five in a row turn-based strategy game for two players.

Created with [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/) with [Chickensoft](https://chickensoft.games/) tools, libraries and [proposed architecture](https://chickensoft.games/blog/game-architecture).

Made in order to explore and learn game development with Godot and C# through a smaller project.
